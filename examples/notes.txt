First impressions

C like syntax is not great
std::io
Double colon stuff is more typing than . in other languages

I keep forgetting the ! for things like assert!

Vectors instead of "list"


Imports
prelude convention for * imports
Otherwise explicit


Returns, putting a semi-colon after the last value broke the program
